Alex is a vibrant, feisty Melbournian with a soft spot for cats and small children.  She has been drawing since forever and has worked on big acrylic portraits, tiny comic-style zines, animated music videos and quick texta portraits drawn from life while you wait.

You can leaf through a conglomeration of her latest projects at [her blog: alexeclark.blogspot.com](http://alexeclark.blogspot.com).

A few of my favourites relevant to portraits from photos are:

* [a family portrait with a Christmas surfing theme](http://alexeclark.blogspot.com.au/2012/12/blog-post_25.html) (this family also had a portrait done as astronauts - it became an annual tradition)
* [a cat and owner in the style of American Gothic](http://alexeclark.blogspot.com.au/2012/12/blog-post.html)
* [D'Artagnan the cavalier](http://alexeclark.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/dartagnancavalier-portrait-plus-process.html)

She is also involved in running a gallery and studying 3D Animation.

(disclaimer: Alex is my sister, so I probably get indirect kick backs in the form of those sorts of presents which Aunties are great at arranging for their nephews)
