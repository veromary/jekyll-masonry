Researching how to make a website to sell portraits I came across this amazing endeavour from a bunch of Sydney-based entrepreneurs.

The website itself smoothly guides the customer through the process of ordering an oil painting or pencil drawing.  There are glowing testimonials with photographs including close up details.

The design side of me is seriously awed by their technical skill in a well executed web page.

The artist's advocate side baulks at the lack of credit given to the artists themselves.

Picarto's system sends work to an artist from Hong Kong, Sweden, Australia or China.
