Researching how to make a website to sell portraits I came across this amazing endeavour from a bunch of Sydney-based entrepreneurs.

The website itself smoothly guides the customer through the process of ordering a painting or charcoal drawing.  There are glowing testimonials with photographs including close up details.

The design side of me is seriously awed by their technical skill in a well executed web page.

The artist's advocate side baulks at the lack of credit given to the artists themselves.
